					<h2> I MEAN ISN'T IT POSSIBLE? </h2>
						<p>I saw an IBM computer when I was in grade 8. After finishing my high school, I learned MSDOS, MS Windows, MS Office Packages, Multimedia, and Email/Internet. Despite studying English Literature as a major in university, I taught computer science in school. Studying one and teaching differrent subjects whisked me away to the field of DH. I found learning computer programs riveting. I independently learnt LOGO, QBASIC, C/C++, SPSS, WordPress, HTML, Photoshop, SQL. Now I am learning Python and hope to learn R as well. I used blogs, EDMODO, and BlackBoard to teach/communicate my students. I worked with Professor Stefan Sinclair on Literary Text Analysis. And it helped me to construe a minimum level of insight on how text can be manipulated using Python codes. DH features computer technology and the humanities both. It uses the digital resources in the humanities or vice versa. I feel good because I am studying Digital Humanities - one of the most emerging discipline; at McGill University - one of the best universities in the world. I surely believe The Digital Humanities course has subserved me to expand my understanding on DH. I am interested in Machine Learning, Text Mining, and Postcolonial DH.</p>

I saw an IBM computer when I was in grade 8. After finishing my high school, I learned MSDOS, MS Windows, MS Office Packages, Multimedia, and Email/Internet. Despite studying English Literature as a major in university, I taught computer science in school. Studying one and teaching differrent subjects whisked me away to the field of DH.

I found learning computer programs riveting. I independently learnt LOGO, QBASIC, C/C++, SPSS, WordPress, HTML, Photoshop, SQL. Now I am learning Python and hope to learn R as well. I used blogs, EDMODO, and BlackBoard to teach/communicate my students. These are the blogs that I created: https://baldhakal.wordpress.com/, http://balkdhakal.blogspot.com/

I am working with Professor Stefan on Literary Text Analysis. And it is helping me to construe a minimum level of insight on how text can be manipulated using Python codes. DH features computer technology and the humanities both. It uses the digital resources in the humanities or vice versa.  I feel good because I am studying Digital Humanities - one of the most emerging discipline; at McGill University - one of the best universities in the world.

I surely believe The Digital Humanities course will subserve me to expand my understanding on DH. I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and Postcolonial DH. The third objective of the course (to support students in undertaking their own research on Electronic Literature, in which they engage theoretical and cultural questions related to the themes of the course) would really succour me to move towards postcolonial DH.
<br>
Reading New Digital Worlds: Postcolonial Digital Humanities in Theory, Praxis, and Pedagogy by Roopika Risam helped me to understand Postcolonial DH. My presentation on “E-Lit and Postcolonial DH” would be based on this book.

It would be efficacious for the developing countries like Nepal in order to address the cry of technology in the field of social sciences.
